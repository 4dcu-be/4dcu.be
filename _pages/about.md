# About me ...


Hi, I’m Sebastian! I was born in the 1980s, hold a PhD in Bioinformatics, and am passionate about blending my knowledge of computers with biology. Outside of work, I enjoy movies, (retro) gaming, sports, and traveling.  

This blog is a space where I share projects I’m working on during my spare time—mainly to sharpen my programming skills, explore new technology, and have fun. Expect posts about games, machine learning, hardware tinkering, programming, and web development, among other tech-centric topics.  

If you’re curious about my research, visit [sebastian.proost.science](https://sebastian.proost.science) to dive into what I’m working on professionally. For travel stories, check out [Beyond the Known](https://www.beyond-the-known.eu/).

### Why *4DCu.be*?  

It’s pronounced *4D Cube*! A 4D cube, also known as a hypercube or [tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract), is the four-dimensional equivalent of a cube, just as a cube is the 3D equivalent of a square. The concept pops up in everything from Marvel blockbusters to cult classics like [Cube²: Hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_2:_Hypercube). It felt like the perfect name for a blog focused on tech, programming, and creative projects.
