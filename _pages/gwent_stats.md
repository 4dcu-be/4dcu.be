## How many Pro Rank players are there ?

At the end of each season the website can be scraped to figure out how many Pro Ranked players there were (described in
[this post]({% post_url 2021/2021-01-24-GwentProPlayersAnalysis %}). Note that longer seasons typically have more
players reaching Pro ladder than shorter seasons.

## How many players are there on regular ladder ?

We don't know, but **at least 100 000**.

Recently I've played very little, dropping quite a bit in rank. After playing one game my position on regular ladder
was 100 001st. A few more games and this was still the case, only when hitting 300+ MMR my position started to improve.
Though this suggests the client shows position 100 001 for all players outside the top 100k. So we really don't know 
how many players there are in total, but we can say at least 100 000 people play a few games a month.

## How popular is Gwent ?

As the number of Pro Ranked players depends on the length of the season, a better metric is how many players reach 
Pro Rank on an average day. This gives an indication how many people are playing and hence how popular Gwent is.
