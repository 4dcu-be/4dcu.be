Recently [Team Bandit Gang]'s very own [Babyjosus] has been very active pushing out new Gwent content! He has been
interviewing people of the community (including [me]) about the decks they play and why in the series 
[Whats in my Deckbuilder]. Their PodCast, the [Iron Falcon Report], even got a 
shout out from the man, [Pawel Burza], himself.

I'm happy to have been able to contribute to this by writing an article discussing the results from my post on the number
of players in Gwent's Pro Ladder. For technical details check out the original post [here]. For the discussion about
the past and current popularity of Gwent and whether it is dead, dying or very much alive, **head over to my [article]** 
on [Team Bandit Gang]'s website.
