My brand new [Aqara Sensors] were on the very edge of my Zigbee range, resulting in unwanted disconnects every few
days. Fortunately Sweden's largest contemporary designer has a cheap solution ... though getting it to run with
[Home Assistant] was a bit of a challenge.

The temperature, humidity and pressure sensors linked to Home Assistant in a [previous post] were working great ...
until they stopped, requiring a reset. Which would solve the problem for a day or two before reoccurring... these
sensors were too far away from the Raspberry Pi with the Zigbee receiver to have a stable connection, so a repeater
was required to extend the range. I noticed Ikea actually has a few Zigbee devices, and the repeater I needed, maybe ...
as it was not clear if this would work with my Aqara Sensors and Home Assistant, though given these are only 10 bucks I
picked one up and started experimenting...

## Switching to HomeAssistant OS

Initially I was running Home Assistant Core from a Python virtual environment and using Supervisor to make sure it was
initiated on boot and restarted upon failure. This allowed me to run a few other applications on the same Raspberry Pi,
but as Home Assistant is getting more and more advanced it was getting harder and harder to install add-ons. The newer
add-ons are provided as Docker containers, and these cannot be included in Home Assistant Core, so I flashed the [Home
Assistant Operating System] to the Pi's SD card and got started with the official documentation. Once HA was running
again, albeit without any devices, we can start to set up the Zigbee devices.

First there are a few add-ons to install. In the new version this can all be done using the 
admin interface (**Supervisor** --> **Add-ons Store**) and no tinkering with the command line is required.

  * [Mosquitto-MQTT]: The broker for passing messages from devices to and from Home Assistant
  * [Zigbee2MQTT]: Required to get the Zigbee antenna to work and pair with devices.
  * [File Editor] and/or [Samba share] : To edit configuration files

The main reason for switching to Home Assistant OS is that the [Zigbee2MQTT] add-on has a few advantages over manually
installing the service in the background (as I did previously). To correctly get devices to pair with the repeater and
explore the Zigbee network map those features are a boon. So let's start adding devices!

## Pair Zigbee devices

**Unlike** what is mentioned on other websites, Zigbee devices **do not** manage the route to the central antenna through
repeaters themselves (or at least not through the Tradfri ones). I wasted a fair amount of time on this before realizing 
that the repeater simply remained unused. Therefore, it is imperative that you pair the 
devices to the repeater correctly. Fortunately, using the Zigbee2MQTT interface this is relatively straightforward to do.
First, goto **Zigbee2mqtt** (in the sidebar) and click  **Permit join (All)**, this will give you a four-minute window
to pair devices. I paired an [Aqara Cube] (open the battery lid, hold the button for 5 seconds until the blue LED blinks,
make sure to move/shake the cube while waiting for it to pair, otherwise it will go into sleep mode which will cause the
pairing to fail) and the [Ikea Tradfri repeater] (push with
a pin the button in the hole and hold for 5-10 seconds, the light will fade in-and-out while pairing). This can take
a minute or two, so be patient, once devices show up in the list you can click on the edit button and give them a 
proper name.

<div class="gallery-2-col" markdown="1">

![Next only permit devices to pair through the repeater to add the sensors](/assets/posts/2021-04-28-MQTT-Ikea-Tradfri/zigbee_all_added.png)
</div>

Next, to pair the Aquara sensors, click on the triangle next to **Permit join (All)** and select the repeater you want
to connect the sensor to (I named mine Tradfri Repeater). Then click on the button **Permit join (name repeater)**. Start
pairing the devices. These sensors have a button on top, hold that for 5 seconds until the blue LED blinks, 2-3 fast
flashes indicate the device paired. Again, be patient for the devices to show up in the list, and change the names
to something logical by clicking the blue button **Rename device**. You can check the topology of your Zigbee network, and
if devices are paired correctly, by clicking **Map** --> **Load Map**.

## Configuring devices

While more and more settings can be altered through the Admin interface, right now I did most of the configuration by
editing YAML files based off my previous configuration. Using the [File Editor] you can start modifying 
```configuration.yaml```, ```automations.yaml```, ... for the Aqara cube
the same configuration as described in [this post]({% post_url 2020-09-10-MQTT %}) still worked. Alternatively, if you 
install the [Samba share] add-on, you can map the Raspberry Pi as a network drive in Windows. From
that path all configuration files can be directly edited using your favorite text editor.

For these changes to take effect you'll have to restart Home Assistant, which can be done from **Configuration** --> **Server Controls**,
make sure to use the **Check Configuration** to validate the changes you made before restarting and putting them into
production.

The sensors don't need much configuration, though I did need to add cards to the interface again. Here code from a 
[previous post] was re-used as well, though now the friendly name could be used for the device, much easier.


```yaml
type: vertical-stack
title: Bedroom
cards:
  - type: glance
    entities:
      - entity: sensor.aqara_sensor_001_temperature
      - entity: sensor.aqara_sensor_001_humidity
      - entity: sensor.aqara_sensor_001_pressure
      - entity: sensor.aqara_sensor_001_battery
    show_name: false
  - type: horizontal-stack
    cards:
      - type: sensor
        entity: sensor.aqara_sensor_001_temperature
        graph: line
        name: ' Temperature (48 h)'
        hours_to_show: 48
      - type: sensor
        entity: sensor.aqara_sensor_001_humidity
        graph: line
        name: ' Humidity (48 h)'
        hours_to_show: 48
```

## Conclusion

The [Ikea Tradfri repeater] does a great job for its price and does work with the Aqara devices once paired correctly. However,
you can't rely on devices figuring out the best path to the central point and devices need to be paired according to the 
network topology that fits your needs. As the [Zigbee2MQTT] add-on is the easiest way to do this, it did force me to 
switch to the [Home Assistant Operating System] which means the Raspberry Pi is now dedicated to HA and 
unless I can figure out how to run my other applications (like my [MemoBoard] for shopping, todo, ... lists) as HA 
add-ons, I'll have to find another solution for those. Though the additional add-ons for Home Assistant and the ease 
to install them more than make up for that.
