Recently my post on the analysis of [Gwent Pro Rank] data was picked up by a member of a Gwent Team, [Team Bandit Gang],
 and they reached out! After pitching some ideas back and forth I ended up doing an analysis on climbing the ladder in
 Pro Rank. Want to find out if this is skill or grinding games? Head over to their website and read the article I 
 wrote for their website [here](https://teambanditgang.com/climbing-pro-ladder-grind-vs-skill/).
 
If you want to grab a copy of the data and scripts used, head over to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/4dcu-be/GwentRank),
where you can find all that. There is already some code there that hints towards something I've been brewing ... stay tuned
for more analyses of Gwent Pro Rank data later !
