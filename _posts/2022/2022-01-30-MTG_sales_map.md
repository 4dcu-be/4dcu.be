Since a few months I've been selling some [Magic: the Gathering] cards on [CardMarket]. Last week I realized I could 
extract the address from buyers from eml files (exported emails) with orders. From those the (approximate*) location 
using Google's [Geocoding API] can be found and plotted using [Altair]. This gives a visual overview where my cards are ending up !

Hovering over the map shows summary stats for each country or location. The color coding can be changed dynamically with
the combo-box below the chart. Locations close to each other are combined and shown with a larger dot, 
numbers inside the dots indicate how many orders were shipped to that municipality (or combination of municipalities).

As there are some cool bits of code used here (some [GeoPandas], clustering on [haversine] distance, ...) there will
be a full-length blog post, outlining those tricks in the future!

(*) to ensure buyers' addresses aren't made public, the center of their municipality is used instead of the exact 
location.
