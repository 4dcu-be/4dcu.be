<article class="post-content" data-pagefind-body>
  <p>The latest version of our software, StableDiffusion, aptly named SDXL, has recently been launched. This has 
simultaneously ignited an interest in <a href="https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI">ComfyUI</a>, a new tool that simplifies usability of these models. It’s 
important to note, however, that the node-based workflows of ComfyUI markedly differ from the <a href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui">Automatic1111</a> framework 
that I previously utilized (you can find my tips and tricks using that framework in a <a href="/aiart/2022/12/31/Stable-Diffusion-Workflow.html">previous post</a>). In this article, 
I’ll take you through some techniques I have found effective when working with ComfyUI.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Not too long ago, an awesome artist and YouTuber, Ten Hundred (or Ten Hun), held a competition 
that welcomed everyone to create their unique interpretation of his art toy: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw3KCIsGhrU">Hammerhood</a>. I seized this 
opportunity to experiment with the technologies I was delving into at that moment, namely StableDiffusion 2.1 and 
ControlNet. So, I decided to create and submit a version that was entirely generated by AI.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/ai_hammerhood_versions.jpg" class="lightgallery-link" data-sub-html="Four versions of Ten Hun's Hammerhood made using StableDiffusion 2.1 and ControlNet">
<img src="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/ai_hammerhood_versions.jpg" alt="Four versions of Ten Hun's Hammerhood made using StableDiffusion 2.1 and ControlNet" height="2400" width="2400" class="small-image" data-src="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/ai_hammerhood_versions.jpg" loading="lazy" />
</a></p>

<p>In the spirit of clarity and transparency, I made it a point to mention in the submission description that this 
creation was born out of artificial intelligence. Surprisingly though, my AI-generated images found a place among the 
featured submissions on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh-ArhaGOqFsBPrR2yQd42w">Ten Hun’s channel</a>! Unsurprisingly, my 
AI-manufactured artwork couldn’t compete with the winning entries,highlighting the irreplaceable creative human touch 
in the domain of art that currently remains unmatched by AI.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/ten_hun_feature.jpg" class="lightgallery-link" data-sub-html="Ten Hun showcasing my Hammerhood submission on his channel">
<img src="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/ten_hun_feature.jpg" alt="Ten Hun showcasing my Hammerhood submission on his channel" height="1008" width="2097" class="medium-image" data-src="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/ten_hun_feature.jpg" loading="lazy" />
</a></p>

<p>Since the submission of these images, Stability AI has introduced a range of new tools, prompting me to refine my 
original workflow. So in this post I’ll outline the new workflow I’ve adopted specifically those that include 
ControlNet.</p>

<h2 id="the-new-tools">The new tools</h2>

<p>To follow along this post you’ll need to install a few new tools and download the new models. Each of these tools 
comes with its own detailed installation guide, which you should closely follow for a seamless setup. Please keep in     <br />
mind that, given the innovative nature of these software tools, the installation process might be slightly more 
intricate than that of conventional software packages.</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://openmodeldb.info/">ESRGAN Upscaler models</a>: I recommend getting an UltraSharp model (for photos) and Remacri (for paintings), but there are many options optimized for various uses.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-comfyui-workflows-with-controlnet">My ComfyUI workflows with ControlNet</h2>

<p>For the art challenge, we were offered several reference images. In this case, I’ve used one of the 3D renders as the 
reference. First, this picture will pass through two pre-precessors: a depth map and edge detection. The depth map makes 
sure we capture the overall shape of the subject, whether it’s an object or a person in a specific pose. Combining it
with an edge detection tool helps to maintain even the fine details. As a result we can alter an image while 
maintaining its recognizability.</p>

<p>In ComfyUI it is essential to connect all nodes properly, ensuring each model contributes as needed. Once this is set up 
correctly, you have a host of 
customizable options at your disposal - from tweaking the reference image to deciding the influence of each ControlNet on the 
final outcome. Coupled with the variety options offered by prompts and LoRa models, this method hands you tremendous control 
over the content and composition of an image.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/dual_controlnet_workflow.jpg" class="lightgallery-link" data-sub-html="CompyUI workflow with two controlnets combined, SDXL base model with offset noise LoRa">

</a></p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/dual_controlnet_basic.json"><strong>Download this workflow</strong></a> as a .json file.</p>

<p>Note that once you have an image close
to what you need, you can still use the img2img to generate similar images as shown in a <a href="/aiart/2022/12/31/Stable-Diffusion-Workflow.html">previous post</a>! Load the image using the appropriate 
node, run it through a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VAE Encode</code> node, and use the resulting latent as the input for the sampler (replacing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Empty Latent Image</code> as the staring point). Don’t forget to lower the denoise 
strength (0.6 to give the AI a lot of freedom to change the input image, the lower this value, the less flexibility it 
has) and you are good to go.</p>

<p>Bear in mind, you don’t need to use the <a href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0">SDXL Refiner</a> for pieces where you’re aiming for an artistic, painterly style. 
However, if you’re hoping to create something with a more lifelike or photorealistic look, using the refiner can be a 
great help.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/mandalorian_hammerhood.jpg" class="lightgallery-link" data-sub-html="The Mandalorian as Hammerhood, or is it the other way around?">
<img src="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/mandalorian_hammerhood.jpg" alt="The Mandalorian as Hammerhood, or is it the other way around?" height="1024" width="1024" class="small-image" data-src="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/mandalorian_hammerhood.jpg" loading="lazy" />
</a></p>

<p>If you are looking for a similar workflow which does include the refiner, <a href="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/dual_controlnet_refiner.json"><strong>download it here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>While the refiner offers a boon for photorealism, including an img2img step, to iterate over an image multiple times,
is harder with the required <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KSampler (advanced)</code> nodes.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/girl_with_pearl_earring.jpg" class="lightgallery-link" data-sub-html="The Girl with the Pearl Earring, the original an depicted as a bronze statue and a photorealistic old woman">
<img src="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/girl_with_pearl_earring.jpg" alt="The Girl with the Pearl Earring, the original an depicted as a bronze statue and a photorealistic old woman" height="1024" width="2048" class="medium-image" data-src="/assets/posts/2023-09-04-comfyui-sdxl-workflows/girl_with_pearl_earring.jpg" loading="lazy" />
</a></p>

<h2 id="exploring-other-workflows">Exploring Other Workflows</h2>

<p>Are you interested in not using ControlNet but want to delve into SDXL and the refiner? Take a look at the 
<a href="https://github.com/SytanSD/Sytan-SDXL-ComfyUI">Sytan SDXL ComfyUI</a> workflow. This is the basis for my <a href="https://github.com/sepro/SDXL-ComfyUI-workflows">other workflows</a>, which are readily available on GitHub and 
also incorporates an upscale phase. Using <a href="https://openmodeldb.info/">ESRGAN Upscaler models</a>, this phase amplifies the resolution of the created 
images, maintaining high quality.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Wrapping your head around <a href="https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI">ComfyUI</a> and using a node-based system may initially seem challenging, especially if you’re 
new to this, but nonetheless, it’s an incredibly potent instrument. <a href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui">Automatic1111</a> also is a dependable choice that 
supports SDXL if you refer a more traditional UI; there’s nothing wrong with that either!</p>

<p>The rapid advancements in this field never cease to astonish me. Whereas with SD2.1 certain elements were nearly 
impossible to perfect, SDXL renders them correctly (hands are still the biggest issue). The base model’s capacity for 
realism has escalated and the resolution has significantly improved. For individuals like me who need a creative outlet occasionally and are more skilled with computer engineering than paintbrushes, this toolkit is pivotal in creating cool looking images.</p>
