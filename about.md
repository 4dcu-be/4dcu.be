A 4D cube, also known as a hypercube or [tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract), is the 4D equivalent of 
a cube, just as a cube is the 3D equivalent of a square. It appears very often in popular (and less popular) culture 
ranging from Marvel Blockbusters to cult-classics (e.g. 
[CubeÂ²: Hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_2:_Hypercube)). Seemed like a suitable name  for a blog focusing 
on tech, programming and building things.
